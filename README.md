## [Medication Waste Reduction](https://github.com/saabirjp/Medication-Waste-Reduction)
This is a R Dashboard to analyze medication wastage in a pharmacy. The pharmacy has a batch production mode and wants to shift to a Just-in-Time production mode. The dashboard visualizes the waste in terms of dollar amount and doses for each drug individually as well as all of them together. A regression model is used to understand the relationship between drug waste and the hour of the day. The final tab in the dashboard models a just-in-time production mode and highlights the savings made.


## [Finding Player Opportunities](https://github.com/saabirjp/Finding-Opportunities)
This a tableau dashboard to analyze 16,000 soccer players, mapping them by Opportunity Ratio and Value. Filters by age, nationality, and scores help identify undervalued players with high potential. Dynamic charts show value changes, profits, and best countries for investment, offering managers insights for building teams.
